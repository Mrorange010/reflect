This app is a voice-first wellness reflection assistant that helps users track their mood, goals, and emotional progress over time. Instead of traditional journaling, users receive AI-driven phone calls twice a week — one at the start of the week to set intentions and one at the end to reflect on their progress and emotional state.

Between calls, users can also interact with the AI via text chat to log thoughts, events, or feelings — all of which are analyzed and structured using LLMs and stored for weekly insights.

🔁 Interaction Flow
Monday (Start of Week): AI calls user → captures goals, mood, energy, intentions

Weekdays/Weekends: User can chat with AI to add events, emotions, etc.

Friday/Sunday (End of Week): AI calls again → captures achievements, mood, reflections

All inputs (calls + chat) are processed → structured data is saved in Supabase

User sees their dashboard: mood trends, goals vs. outcomes, highlights, summaries
