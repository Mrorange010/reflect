Task,Explained
Pass captured user data points from Elevenlabs to Supabase,"Right now we capture datapoints like ""challenges"" or ""notable_events"" and their reasoning in Elevenlabs, we need this data to be passed to supabase using a Edge Function and Elevenlabs Webhook to pass the data to the fields we have in our table ""weekly_reflections"""
Pass users name to Elevenlabs so the agent can mention it,"The user is asked for their first name during onboarding, which is saved to the ""user"" table. It would be nice and personalized if the Elevenlabs Agent mentions the name during the call. However, we need to pass this ""name"" column data from the user table from Supabase to Elevenlabs."
In the onboarding let users pick a time to call them,"Right now users can pick morning, afternoon or evening which is not helpful when you want to schedule calls. Let the user pick a time for the beginning of the week on Monday, and pick a time to call for the AI at the end of the week on a Friday. We can save this data by altering the ""user_settings"" table with now call_time we remove this and change it to ""call_start"" and ""call_end"" and we save a time here based on their preference. However we do need to make sure this is based on their timezone, so we need to check the system time and date of their phone for this to make sense. We should also show in this screen to the user the option to determine when their week starts from Monday to Friday working week or Sunday to Thursday (some arab countries have this schedule)."
Schedule the AI calls at the chosen time,"The App should ""call"" the user by showing the Call Screen to the user at their decided upon time for the beginning of the week and end of the week we load the call times from Supabase and can store this locally in the app until something changes so we dont have to call the database for this."
Set up two Call Agents - Beginning of week + end of week,"Right now we hooked up one Agent for testing, but we will need to agents as they approach each call different. One is at the start of the week and will ask the user how their weekend was, anything special happened, plans for the upcoming week etc.. Its focussed on whats to come. At the end of the week the second AI Agent will call and this time will ask how was your week, anything noticable, any challenges, how do you feel overall and plans for the weekend. This way we cover the start and finish of the engagement for the user."
Pass captured data from the beginning of the week agent to the end of the week agent,"We need the second end of the week agent to be able to reflect on the week. For example the user might tell the beginning of the week elevenlabs AI agent that they have a big meeting on Thursday, it would be an amazing experience if the AI can ask about this at the end of the week and say, you mentioned a big meeting on Thursday how did it go? But in order for that to work we need to set up the Knowledge base somehow to be connected from Supabase to Elevenlabs so it knows about this.  "
Pass captured weekend data from the end of the week agent to the beginning of the week agent,"Same as the previous point. The beginning of the week agent should be able to know what the weekend plans were for example if there was anything noticable it could ask about it instead of just asking how was your weekend. Or if they said at the end of the week that the week after on Tuesday there is a wedding, it should be able to take this noticable event and ask about it at the start of the week like ""are you excited for the wedding Tuesday?"" So we want to make the AI context aware."
Create detail view of logs with captured data ,We need to show nice detail views of each day from Supabase into the app so the user can see their interaction data visually
Create dashboard view with actual data from calls,We need to show nice dashboard of each day from Supabase into the app so the user can see their interaction data visually
Hook up OpenAI API to chat screen to interact with user,"When the user has called on a Monday for example, we want the option to also go to our chat screen to share new updates with the AI. For example on Monday James had a call with the AI and shared all the info he wanted to shared but suddenly on Tuesday had big news like his brother getting a baby and he is super excited about it. He should be able to go to the chat panel and tell the AI about it. The OpenAI API is connected here which allows for the user to connect in a natural conversation."
Set prompt for OpenaAI to extract similar data points as Elevenlabs,"We also need a good prompt, I already have a file for this which has all the same capturing points equal to Elevenlabs. During the chat the AI should be able to update the database with new events or news shared by the user so it keeps the knowledge up to date. This way we have calls at the start of the week, text messages during the week and at the end of the week we check in with the user again. Over the weekend they can continue to text. This creates a nice loop of interaction."
Pass captured data points from OpenAI Chat to Supabase,When the datapoints during the text messages (see previous 2 tasks) equal to Elevenlabs calls are captured by OpenAI it should pass this along to Supabase so we update the users data.
Add log out button to settings screen,Allows the user to log out of the app at the bottom
Add change email to settings screen,Allow the user to update their email
Add change password to settings screen,Allow the user to change their password
Add change AI contacting times in settings screen,In case the user does not want to be called anymore at the previous defined times or wants to change the start and end of the week day
Add delete account in settings screen,"Add this but super small at the bottom, and make sure there is a warning popup that ALL data will be deleted. When confirmed we erase all the data from the database for the user."
